Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

You should create one R script called mycode.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts  the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names 
4. labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

######### How to run the Project

Running the script:

1. Change current directory to the UCI HAR Dataset folder;
3. Open and Run the R script `mycode.r`;
5. The tidy dataset should get created in the current directory: Validate the directory and verify if the txt`` file, called `tidy-UCI-HAR-dataset-AVG.txt`` was created.

NOTE:  `mycode.R` - is the code does all the work

########## finally these are the files produced:

1. Tidy dataset file `tidy-UCI-HAR-dataset-AVG.txt` 
2. Tidy dataset file `tidy-UCI-HAR-dataset.txt` 
3. Codebook file `codebook.md` (Markdown)
